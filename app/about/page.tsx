      About Me
    </h1>
    <p className='text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6'>
      Welcome to my next-blog-portfolio! 
    </p>
    <p className='text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6'>
      Iâ€™m a perpetually
      broke but wildly passionate developer, scraping by on instant noodles and
      dreams of clean code.  
    </p>
    <p className='text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6'>
      I sling modern web apps with Next.js, React, and
      TypeScript like a caffeine-fueled wizard, turning bugs into features and
      deadlines into adrenaline rushes. 
    </p>
    <p className='text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6'>
      Join me in this broke-dev saga where
      passion != paycheck, and every line of code is a step closer to my next
      ramen bowl.
